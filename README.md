# Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a robust weed detection system for agricultural applications.
• Implemented a multi-class image classification system using CNNs, achieving high accuracy in identifying various
weed species within agricultural fields.
<br>
• Employed Dropout and Batch Normalization techniques to mitigate overfitting and enhance the model’s general-
ization capabilities, resulting in improved performance across diverse datasets.
<br>
• Optimized training using techniques including dynamic learning rate adjustment, early stopping, and Transposed
CNNs, reducing false positives for real-world usabilityv
